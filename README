About
-----
This project implements a plugin for Jira 4.0.1 and 4.3.4 providing a gadget that displays a chart over how the number
of bugs of your filter have changed over time (one year period) and groups the bugs by category (severeness).

The project consists of the following parts:
- The plugin descriptor (resources/atlassian-plugin.xml) describing the plugin for Jira.
- The gadget specification (resources/bug-mountain-gadget.xml) describing and implementing the gadget. The gadget
  uses Atlassians extension of OpenSocial gadgets and consists of descriptor and javascript code.
- A REST service (java.com.ongame.jira.BugMountain) for servicing the gadget with chart generation (and name lookup)
  for filters and projects. The service uses JFreeChart for chart generation.


Build
-----
1) First of all you need to install atlassian-plugin-sdk on your machine. I used version 3.2.3. Follow the instructions
   for the plugin sdk.

2) Run "atlas-compile && atlas-package" from your shell in your project root. The maven-based build will download
   dependencies and eventually produce a bugmountain-1.x.jar in your target folder.


Publish
-------
1) Change version in pom.xml.
2) Rebuild.
3) Scp target/bugmountain-x.x.jar yourname@ivy.bgs.gameop.net:
4) Ssh to ivy.bgs.gameop.net and move the file to the /var/cmtools/bugmountain folder.
5) Change owner (chown) to buildm:buildm for the file.


Deploy
------
1) Copy the bugmountain-1.0.jar to your JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed_plugins.

2) Edit the log4j configuration located at JIRA_INSTALL/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties, adding the following lines:
#####
## Bugmountain plugin
####
log4j.logger.com.ongame.jira = INFO, console, filelog
log4j.additivity.com.ongame.jira = false

3) Restart Jira.

4) Enable the remote api calls option in general settings within Jira.

5) You should now have a Bugmountain gadget to use for your pleasure and enjoyment.
